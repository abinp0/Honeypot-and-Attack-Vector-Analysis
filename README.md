# Honeypot-and-Attack-Vector-Analysis


#Project Objective

The Cowrie Honeypot Deployment and Attack Vector Analysis project is to create a controlled environment that attracts cyber attackers, allowing us to study their behavior, capture attack vectors, and enhance our network security awareness.
The project is to deploy a set of honeypots emulating various network services, including FTP, web, and SSH servers, to attract and analyze potential attacker behavior. By setting up these honeypots, we aim to identify common attack vectors, monitor malicious activities, and gain insights into the techniques used by attackers.

By deploying the Cowrie honeypot, we aim to achieve the following:

<b>1.Deployment and Configuration:</b>
- Successfully set up and configure the Cowrie honeypot.
- Customize banners, services, and responses to mimic real systems.
- Ensure the honeypot is strategically placed within the network.
  
<b>2.Attack Vector Analysis:</b>
- Investigate real-world attack patterns and techniques.
- Identify common attack vectors (e.g., brute force, vulnerability exploitation).
- Analyze captured logs to gain insights into attacker behavior.
  
<b>3.Monitoring and Insights:</b>
- Regularly monitor honeypot logs.
- Extract meaningful information from the data collected.
- Understand how attackers target systems and adapt their tactics.
  
<b>4.Lessons Learned and Recommendations:</b>
- Importance of continuous monitoring and analysis.
- Share insights with the cybersecurity community.
- Balancing realism and security in honeypot configuration.
  
<b><i>Through this project, we aim to contribute to the field of cybersecurity, enhance our skills, and better defend against evolving threats.</i></b> ðŸš€ðŸ”’
